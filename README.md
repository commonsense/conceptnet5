ConceptNet aims to give computers access to common-sense knowledge, the kind of
information that ordinary people know but usually leave unstated.

This Python package contains a toolset for building the ConceptNet 5 knowledge
graph, possibly with your own custom data, and it serves the HTML interface and
JSON Web API for it.

You don't need this package to simply access ConceptNet 5; see
http://conceptnet.io for more information and a browsable Web interface.

Further documentation is available on the Wiki: https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki

## Discussion groups

If you're interested in using ConceptNet, please join the conceptnet-users
Google group, for questions and occasional announcements:

## System requirements

To be able to run all steps of the ConceptNet build process, you'll need:

* Python 3.4 or later
* A Python environment where NumPy and SciPy can be installed, or already
  are installed
* Standard GNU command-line tools such as `sort` and `uniq`
* `libhdf5` for reading and writing matrices of data
* PostgreSQL 9.5 or later, with a database named `conceptnet5` that you can
  write to
* The `CONCEPTNET_DB_USER`, `CONCEPTNET_DB_PASSWORD`, and optionally
  `CONCEPTNET_DB_HOSTNAME` environment variables should be set so that you
  can connect to the database

These can be set up automatically within a container, using Docker Compose; see
the [Docker instructions](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/Running-your-own-copy).
We highly recommend using Docker Compose if you want to serve the Web API
locally.


## Installing and building ConceptNet

To install this package, run:

    python3 setup.py develop

To build all the data from raw data, run:

    snakemake -j 8 --resources 'ram=16' all

(`-j 8` says to run 8 processes of Snakemake in parallel, and `ram=16`
constraints the processes that run simultaneously so that they should require
around 16 GB of RAM.)

To build or download only the data necessary to run the Web service:

    snakemake -j 8 webdata

To reproduce an evaluation that shows the strong performance of the
[ConceptNet Numberbatch](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet-numberbatch)
word embeddings:

    snakemake evaluation

To start over when something goes wrong or when the code has changed:

    snakemake clean


## Accessing ConceptNet5 python api over docker

To access ConceptNet5 python api while using docker, set the following environment variables:

    CONCEPTNET_DB_USER=postgres
    CONCEPTNET_DB_HOSTNAME=[Your docker-machine IP]
    CONCEPTNET_IS_REMOTE=true

Warning: this method bypasses a safeguard which ensures the db is fully built before
connecting to the db.  It is up to you to ensure that the database has fully and
correctly been built before using this.
