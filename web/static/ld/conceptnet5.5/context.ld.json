This file defines everything that appears in ConceptNet API responses, mostly for the benefit of software that understands JSON-LD, but it may be reasonably human-readable too. See http://www.conceptnet.io for more information about ConceptNet, http://api.conceptnet.io/docs for the API documentation, or http://json-ld.org/ for an introduction to JSON-LD.",
