    Remove the part of speech and disambiguation (if present) from a concept,

    is to remove the region tag from Chinese assertions, so they are considered
    simply as assertions about Chinese regardless of whether it is Traditional
    or Simplified Chinese. In the cases where they overlap, this helps to make
    the information more complete.

    Convert a JSON stream to a tab-separated "CSV" of concept-to-concept associations.

    The relation is mostly ignored, except:

    - Negative relations create associations between concepts suffixed with '/neg'
    - An assertion that means "People want X" in English or Chinese is converted to
      an assertion between X and "good", and also X and the negation of "bad"
    - Combining both of these, an assertion that "People don't want X" moves the
      negation so that X is associated with "not good" and "bad".

    The result can be used to predict word associations using ConceptNet by using
    dimensionality reduction, as in the `assoc_space` package.

    The relation is mostly ignored because we have not yet found a good way to
    take the relation into account in dimensionality reduction.
