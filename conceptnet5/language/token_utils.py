    Splits apart words that are written in CamelCase.
    Bugs:
    - Non-ASCII characters are treated as lowercase letters, even if they are
      actually capital letters.
    Examples:
    >>> un_camel_case('1984ZXSpectrumGames')
    '1984 ZX Spectrum Games'
    >>> un_camel_case('aaAa aaAaA 0aA  AAAa!AAA')
    'aa Aa aa Aa A 0a A AA Aa! AAA'
    >>> un_camel_case('MotÃ¶rHead')
    'Mot\xf6r Head'
    >>> un_camel_case('MSWindows3.11ForWorkgroups')
    'MS Windows 3.11 For Workgroups'
    This should not significantly affect text that is not camel-cased:
    >>> un_camel_case('ACM_Computing_Classification_System')
    'ACM Computing Classification System'
    >>> un_camel_case('Anne_Blunt,_15th_Baroness_Wentworth')
    'Anne Blunt, 15th Baroness Wentworth'
    >>> un_camel_case('Hindi-Urdu')
    'Hindi-Urdu'
