This file defines everything that appears in ConceptNet API responses, mostly for the benefit of software that understands JSON-LD, but it may be reasonably human-readable too. See http://www.conceptnet.io for more information about ConceptNet, http://api.conceptnet.io/docs for the API documentation, or http://json-ld.org/ for an introduction to JSON-LD.",

A JSON-LD processor won't actually use this section; it only cares about the more specific things defined below in the '@context' section. But I hope it's a good formal description of what's going on in the ConceptNet API, and if you interpret _this_ part with JSON-LD, you'll get out a bunch of RDF facts that could be useful if there's some sort of big Semantic Web revival."
