    Factor a dataframe into two matrices with `k` columns, using the labels
    from the dataframe as the row labels.

    The matrices that are returned are `uframe` and `vframe`. `uframe` assigns
    a k-dimensional vector to each row of the frame, and `vframe` assigns a
    k-dimensional vector to each column. One way to think of these is that
    `uframe` contains the rows of `frame` projected into a k-dimensional space,
    while `vframe` is the operation that projects those rows.

    In SVD terms, after `frame` has been factored into U @ Σ @ V^T,
    `uframe` is U @ sqrt(Σ), and `vframe` is V @ sqrt(Σ).
